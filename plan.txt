if intruders found -> discord bot pings in server and posts link to private twitch stream for video in house....


update-
will instead host a website for streaming to my vps in case an alarm goes off it will record it to my vps and only pass a video feed to my vps directly, I will need to secure this feature down, the video feed will only show the live feed, it will not forward a recording that would be stored out of reach for the site hosted.
