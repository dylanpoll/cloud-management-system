my own react /express /more controller for my raspberry pi network at my house. runs things like a rstp feed for security cameras, implimenting opencv and tensorflow lite soon, led controllers for espboards plugged into leds around the house, it also checks the local network for registered peoples phones to see if they are home and can be used incase something needs to be done at the house when I am not home to know if my room mate can do it for me.
